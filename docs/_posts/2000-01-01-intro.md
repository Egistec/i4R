The i4R fingerprint authentication module (*the module*) is a small form factor rectangle/ square touch type fingerprint sensor with [secure element](https://github.com/Egistec/i4R/wiki/Terms-and-definitions#secure-element)  ([SE](https://github.com/Egistec/i4R/wiki/Terms-and-definitions#se)) embedded integrated module available on the market.  

The fingerprint sensor of *this module*, Egistec ET51x, utilizes tens of thousands of highly sensitive capacitive elements designed under patented sensing architecture, in order to instantaneously capture high resolution images of the fingerprint. Encapsulated and protected by durable molding compound, the sensor is shielded from impact, scratches, as well as everyday wear and tear. Multiple patented ESD (ElectroStatic Discharge) shielding methodologies are implemented in the sensor level as well as in module level. 

For fingerprint sensor, it is powered by a proprietary multi-factor matching algorithm which delivers market leading [False Acceptance Rate](#false-acceptance-rate) ([FAR](https://github.com/Egistec/i4R/wiki/Terms-and-definitions#far)) and [False Rejection Rates](https://github.com/Egistec/i4R/wiki/Terms-and-definitions#false-rejection-rates) ([FRR](https://github.com/Egistec/i4R/wiki/Terms-and-definitions#frr)).  The sensor is ideal for integration in many types of consumer electronic devices, including of mobile phones, tablets, notebook PCs, and wearable devices.

With [ASIC](https://github.com/Egistec/i4R/wiki/Terms-and-definitions#asic)/ [Micro Controller Unit](https://github.com/Egistec/i4R/wiki/Terms-and-definitions#micro-controller-unit) ([MCU](https://github.com/Egistec/i4R/wiki/Terms-and-definitions#mcu)) and [SE](https://github.com/Egistec/i4R/wiki/Terms-and-definitions#se), the fingerprint templates are all stored and processing inside *this module* to ensure the high level security. Hardware generated crypto keys ensure the high level security on the secure channels between components inside of *this module*.

The combination of all of these factors yields a state of the art fingerprint authentication module capable of delivering market-leading usability, security, durability and [FRR](https://github.com/Egistec/i4R/wiki/Terms-and-definitions#frr)/[FAR](https://github.com/Egistec/i4R/wiki/Terms-and-definitions#far) performance - all rolled up into a tiny module operating at the lowest power consumption in the industry.
